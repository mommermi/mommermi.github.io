In the framework of the [MANOS](https://manosobs.wordpress.com/) program, I have been working on an automated data analysis pipeline for calibrated asteroid photometry and astrometry from imaging data. This pipeline, which can be applied to any kind of point source observations, is now in a robust state and available throughÂ [github](https://github.com/mommermi/photometrypipeline).

For details on the pipeline, please refer to Mommert 2017 (in press at Astronomy and Computing, [arxiv](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170200834M)).
