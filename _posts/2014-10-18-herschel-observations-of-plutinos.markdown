Plutinos are a subpopulation of the Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), which are pristine and icy objects on the outskirts of the Solar System. The orbits of Plutinos - which are named after their prototype, Pluto - are in 2:3 resonance with Neptune, meaning that by the time a Plutino performs 2 full orbits around the Sun, Neptune performs 3. This "mean motion resonance" provides a high degree of stability to the orbits of Plutinos. Hence, Plutinos are dynamically and physically pristine objects.

As part of the [TNOs are Cool!](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~tmueller/tno_public/) project we have observed 123 different TNOs, including a number of Plutinos, with the Herschel Space Observatory in the far-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. Herschel measured the thermal emission of these cold objects, which can be combined with optical brightness measurements to constrain their physical properties using _thermal modeling_.

From our observations of 18 Plutinos, one of which was Pluto, I derived the diameters and albedos of these objects.

The grey lines depict the respective probability density function, which takes into account the uncertainties of each measurement.[/caption]

I find a weighted mean albedo of Plutinos of 0.08Â±0.03, which is comparable to Scattered Disk Objects and Hot Classicals, both of which are other TNO subpopulations, as well as the nuclei of short-period comets and Centaurs. A comparison of the measured albedos and diameters with orbital properties shows no significant correlation; however, there is a weak trend of smaller Plutinos to be redder. I also find qualitative evidence that icy Plutinos have higher albedos than the average. Pluto has been excluded from this statistical analysis, as its thermal emission cannot be easily fit with a simple thermal model, which is due to its binarity and atmosphere.

The results of this study have been published as [Mommert et al. (2012)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A..93M) in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

I have also contributed to other publications of the TNOs are Cool project, as listed [here](http://michaelmommert.wordpress.com/publications/%20).
