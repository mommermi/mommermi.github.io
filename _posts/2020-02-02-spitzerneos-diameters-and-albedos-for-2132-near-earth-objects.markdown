Ever since the early days of my PhD thesis, I have been involved in the thermal modeling of thermal-infrared observations of near-Earth objects and other asteroids. 







In the framework of several large-scale [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope) observing programs, we have observed more than 2000 near-Earth objects and measured their thermal emission to constrain their diameters and albedos. The results of these efforts are available in a query-able way here: [http://nearearthobjects.nau.edu/spitzerneos](http://nearearthobjects.nau.edu/spitzerneos)







Now that Spitzer has officially retired, we have finalized our observations and analysis, and compiled all of our results in one large data set. This compilation comprises 2204 diameter and geometric albedo estimates for 2132 different near-Earth objects - the largest homogeneous data set of its kind for this population.







The static backup version of the SpitzerNEOs dataset is now also available here: [https://github.com/mommermi/spitzerneos](https://github.com/mommermi/spitzerneos)
