And now for something completely different...

NLP stands for [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing): the reduction of (written) human language into something a computer can work with. NLP is key to working with text data and enables the detailed analysis of documents, elaborate text searches and classifications, as well as the detection of spam emails.

Being curious about what can be done with NLP, I was looking for some text data I could use to try it out - and ended up with Jane Austen's classic novel _Pride and Prejudice_.

If you are interested in what you can learn about this novel without ever reading it, have a look at this [notebook](https://github.com/mommermi/pride_and_prejudice_and_nlp/blob/master/Pride-and-Prejudice-and-NLP.ipynb)!
