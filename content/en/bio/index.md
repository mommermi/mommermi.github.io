Before, I served as Assistant Professor of Computer Vision (2022 -
2024) at the [School of Computer
Science](https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-computer-science/)
and as Senior Scientist (2020 - 2022) at the [AIML Lab](https://hsg-aiml.github.io/)
of the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en/) (Switzerland), where I gathered experience in deep learning and machine learning.

Previously, my research focused on a completely different field: Solar System Astronomy. As a Postdoc and Associate Researcher at [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/) (2013 - 2018) and as Astronomer at [Lowell Observatory](https://lowell.edu/) (2018-2020), I used ground-based and space-based telescopic observations and numerical models to investigate the physical properties of asteroids and comets and developed scientific software.

Before becoming an astronomer, I received my PhD in Earth Sciences (2013) from the [Free University Berlin]() after finishing my [thesis project](https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/fub188/2283/PhD_mommert_fuonline.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) at the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)]() (2009 -2013). My academic journey began with a diploma (MSc equivalent) in Physics, which I completed at the [University of Heidelberg]() (2004-2009).
