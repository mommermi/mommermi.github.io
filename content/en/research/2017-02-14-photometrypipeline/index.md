title: Photometrypipeline
summary: |
  photometrypipeline is a Python software package for automated image
  registration, calibration, and extraction of photometry tailored to the
  needs of asteroid observer. However, pp can also be applied to other
  imaging observations.

In the framework of the [MANOS](https://www.manos.lowell.edu) program, I have been working on an automated data analysis pipeline for calibrated asteroid photometry and astrometry from imaging data. This pipeline, which can be applied to any kind of point source observations, is now in a robust state and available through [github](https://github.com/mommermi/photometrypipeline).

For details on the pipeline, please refer to official publication (see below).
