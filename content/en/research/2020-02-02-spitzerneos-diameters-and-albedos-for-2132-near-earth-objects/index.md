title: SpitzerNEOs - Diameters and Albedos for 2132 Near-Earth Objects
summary: |
  Based on Spitzer Space Telescope observations, we derived diameter and
  albedo estimates for 2132 asteroids in near-Earth space - the largest
  dataset of its kind. Our results and data are available online.

Ever since the early days of my PhD thesis, I have been involved in
the thermal modeling of thermal-infrared observations of near-Earth
objects and other asteroids. Such asteroid thermal models simulate the surface
temperature distributions of asteroids utilizing some simplifying
assumptions and enabling the estimation of physical properties like
size and albedo.

In the framework of several large-scale [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope) observing programs, we have observed more than 2000 near-Earth objects and measured their thermal emission to constrain their diameters and albedos. Now that Spitzer has officially [retired](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-spitzer-space-telescope-ends-mission-of-astronomical-discovery/), we have finalized our observations and analysis, and compiled all of our results in one large data set. This compilation comprises 2204 diameter and geometric albedo estimates for 2132 different near-Earth objects - the largest homogeneous data set of its kind for this population.
The results of these efforts are available [GitHub](https://github.com/mommermi/spitzerneos).
