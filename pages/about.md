As of May 2020, I am a senior researcher at the
<a href="https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth">
Institute of Computer Science</a> of the
<a href="http://www.unisg.ch">University of St. Gallen</a> where my research 
focuses on the application of Machine Learning techniques to Earth remote
sensing data. </p>

<p align="justify">In my previous life, I worked as an astronomer,
exploring asteroids and comets in our Solar System. As part of this
work, I gained significant experience in automated data processing and
analysis, open-source software development, and the presentation and
visualization of scientific data.</p>

<p align="justify">Results from my current and previous research are
presented on this blog, together with some data science toy projects.</p>
