discovered in 1983 and although it has a perfectly comet-like orbit,
no cometary activity (a tail or a coma around the object) have been
observed. According to protocol, the object was listed as an asteroid.</p>
<p>In 2009, we found from observations with the now defunct Spitzer Space
Telescope that there actually is a faint coma around Don Quixote that most
likely consists of molecular band emission from either CO or CO2. This is
discussed in detail <a href="http://localhost:1313/research/2014-10-19-detection-of-cometary-activity-in-neo-don-quixote/">here</a> and in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...781...25M/abstract">this paper</a>.</p>
<p>At that time, it was unclear whether the observed activity was just a
singular event (e.g., triggered by a recent impact), or whether the
object is recurrently active like an active comet.</p>

      2017 Spitzer IRAC mosaics (inverted greyscale): the left column shows original mosaics, PRF (point-response-function)-subtracted mosaics are shown in the center column, the right column presents radial profiles derived from the different mosaics in instrumental flux density units. All mosaics share the same linear scaling; contour lines are plotted to distinguish discrete flux levels. The 4.5 micron mosaics clearly show extended emission, whereas the target appears as a point source at 3.6 micron. This is reflected by the radial profile plots which show extended emission in the PRF-subtracted brightness profile (blue line) at 4.5 micron, but not at 3.6 micron. The red lines represent the radial brightness profile from the original mosaics and the dashed lines represent a fit to the PRF-subtracted profile. See the full paper for details.

<p>In 2017, Don Quixote was coming back from its trip around the Sun,
providing us with a new opportunity to observe it, and guess
what&hellip; <a href="http://mommermi.github.io/astronomy/2018/07/27/don-quixote-did-it-again.html">it was active
again</a>. We
were able to observe the same molecular band emission from CO and CO2
that we observed in 2009, and - more importantly - for the first time
we observed activity in the optical wavelengths, which is most likely
to be sunlight reflected by dust particles. All results from our
observations are presented by</p>
<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ab8ae5">Mommert, M., Hora, J. L., Trilling, D. E. et al., 2020, <em>Recurrent Cometary Activity in Near-Earth Object (3552) Don Quixote</em>, Planetary Science Journal, 1, 12 (open access)</a>.</p>
<p>So, why is this interesting? It is interesting because what we
observed in 2009 was not a unique event. Don Quixote seems to be
recurrently active, but in a very faint way, comparable to the
faintest observed active comets. Thus, <strong>Don Quixote is most likely an
active comet, too, implying that it has indeed a reservoir of
volatiles, consisting of CO or CO2 and - potentially - water</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="systematic-characterization-of-potentially-active-asteroids">Systematic Characterization of Potentially Active Asteroids</h2>
<p>The case of Don Quixote serves as a reminder that asteroidal
appearance and cometary activity are not exclusive states. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main-belt_comet">Main belt
comets</a> - or Active
Asteroids - are a population of putative main belt asteroids that
exhibit periodic or recurrent comet-like activity. Just like Don
Quixote, some of them have been known as asteroids for many years and
then suddenly show activity. But unlike Don Quixote, most of these
active asteroids do not share a cometary origin. Their activity can be
triggered by a <a href="http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/papers/2015/JHA15.pdf">number of different
mechanisms</a>.</p>
<p>Although most of these mechanisms are not fully understood, enough is
known about them to identify asteroids that are likely to exhibit
activity as a result of one or more of these mechanisms acting upon
them.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started an observing program that observed asteroids from
two target populations, <em>dormant comets</em> and <em>near-Sun
asteroids</em>. Dormant comets are objects similar to Don Quixote: they
move on exceptionally comet-like orbits, but have never shown activity
before. Since they might be of cometary origin, they might contain
large volatile reservoirs, which can have implications for the origin
of terrestrial water and for future resource utilization. Near-Sun
asteroids have very close encounters with the Sun, which makes them
subject to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16934">catastrophic
disruption</a>. The goal of
this study was to systematically characterize dormant comets and
near-Sun asteroids, as well as to find other objects like Don Quixote
or active near-Sun asteroids.</p>
<h1 id="observations">Observations</h1>
<p>Observations were carried out with a range of telescopes, most notably
the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope and the Lowell Observatory&rsquo;s
Discovery Channel Telescope. In total, I spent about 60 nights on the
VATT and about 30 nights on other telescopes for this program.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>My observations resulted in two major findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was able to measure accurate colors of my targets, which in turn
enabled me to derive probabilistic taxonomic classifications with
the help of machine learning. As I found in <a href="http://mommermi.github.io/astronomy/2015/08/21/how-many-dead-comets-are-there.html">my previous study on
dormant
comets</a>,
<strong>only about 50% of asteroids on comet-like orbits also have
comet-like surface compositions</strong>. Interestingly, <strong>all near-Sun
asteroids in my sample turn out to be non-primitive</strong>, which supports
the hypothesis that primitive asteroids disrupt more easily than
non-primitives.</li>
<li>The only target in both my samples showing activity during this
project was - guess who - <strong>Don Quixote</strong>. None of the other targets
showed extended emission or enhanced brightness.</li>
</ul>
<p>All results are discussed in detail by</p>
<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ab8191">Mommert, M., Trilling, D. E., Hora, J. L. et al., 2020, <em>Systematic Characterization of and Search for Activity in Potentially Active Asteroids</em>, Planetary Science Journal, 1, 10 (open access)</a>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>It took me almost a decade to show that Don Quixote is a real comet.
I was hoping to find other active asteroids - dormant comets or
near-Sun asteroids - but unfortunately, I did not. Don Quixote might
be unique in being an active comet hiding among inert asteroids.</p>
<p>And that is basically my astronomical legacy. Now it is up to the
next generation of astronomers to find out more about dormant comets
and Don Quixote!</p>
