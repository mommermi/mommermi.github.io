<p>I am Professor of AI in Remote Sensing at the <a href="https://www.hft-stuttgart.com">Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences</a>, where I was appointed in 2024.</p>
<p>Before, I served as Assistant Professor of Computer Vision (2022 -
2024) at the <a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/universitaet/schools/school-of-computer-science/">School of Computer
Science</a>
and as Senior Scientist (2020 - 2022) at the <a href="https://hsg-aiml.github.io/">AIML Lab</a>
of the <a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/">University of St. Gallen</a> (Switzerland), where I gathered experience in deep learning and machine learning.</p>
<p>Previously, my research focused on a completely different field: Solar System Astronomy. As a Postdoc and Associate Researcher at <a href="https://nau.edu/">Northern Arizona University</a> (2013 - 2018) and as Astronomer at <a href="https://lowell.edu/">Lowell Observatory</a> (2018-2020), I used telescopic observations and numerical models to investigate the physical properties of asteroids and comets and developed scientific software.</p>
<p>Before becoming an astronomer, I received my PhD in Earth Sciences (2013) from the <a href="/">Free University Berlin</a> after finishing my thesis project at the <a href="/">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a> (2009 -2013). My academic journey began with a diploma (MSc equivalent) in Physics, which I completed at the <a href="/">University of Heidelberg</a> (20024-2009).</p>
