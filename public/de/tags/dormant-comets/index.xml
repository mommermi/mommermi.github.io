      <description>Don Quixote has been considered asteroidal since its discovery in 1983,&#xA;despite its comet-like orbit. We found activity in this object during&#xA;its 2009 and 2018 apparitions, leading us to believe that it really&#xA;is an active comet. But are there other objects like Don Quixote? I&#xA;monitored a sample of ~100 asteroids that are somewhat likely to turn&#xA;active, too, over a period of more than 4 years. Bottom line: Don Quixote&#xA;is rather unique.</description>

      <description>Dead comets are small bodies that appear as inactive asteroids, but have&#xA;a cometary origin. Some of these objects might still harbor ices and can&#xA;still activate and appear comet-like. Since these objects might signifcantly&#xA;contribute to the volatile reservoir of the asteroid population, it is&#xA;important to understand how many of these objects there are.</description>
