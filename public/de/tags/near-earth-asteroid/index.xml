      <description>Based on Spitzer Space Telescope observations, we derived diameter and&#xA;albedo estimates for 2132 asteroids in near-Earth space - the largest&#xA;dataset of its kind. Our results and data are available online.</description>

      <title>How many Dead Comets are there?</title>

      <description>Dead comets are small bodies that appear as inactive asteroids, but have&#xA;a cometary origin. Some of these objects might still harbor ices and can&#xA;still activate and appear comet-like. Since these objects might signifcantly&#xA;contribute to the volatile reservoir of the asteroid population, it is&#xA;important to understand how many of these objects there are.</description>

      <title>Rapid-Response Spectrophotometric Observations of NEOs with UKIRT and RATIR</title>

      <description>With rapid-response observations using UKIRT, we are able to observe newly&#xA;discovered near-Earth asteroids when they are still close to Earth and&#xA;thus bright. Our observations enable a probabilistic taxonomic&#xA;classification of asteroids with typically small sizes and the determination&#xA;of their compositional distribution.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of two tiny Asteroids from Spitzer Observations</title>

      <description>We observed two very small asteroids with the Spitzer Space Telescope to&#xA;actually measure their physical properties for the first time. The&#xA;constraints that we were able to place on their properties do not agree&#xA;with the standard picture of small asteroids.</description>
